Completing this was kind of a big deal for me.  I had been away from the curriculum for a few months.  I found the courage to face this project (and the lab/lesson immediately preceding it) by starting from scratch.  After completing the JS and jQuery sections in Codecademy, and faithfully following along with Watch & Code (which, literally changed my life!) I finally started to feel comfortable enough to think in JS.

For some reason, I decided it would be a good learning experience for me to complete all the requirements for this project without jQuery, and use only vanilla JS.  My AJAX functions are a little verbose, as a result, but at this stage, I helps me conceptualize what's happening at a more granular level to have to manage things like attaching CFRS tokens to a 'post' request.

And, since December of 2017 (when I completed the Rails version of this project), my Twitter OmniAuth strategy broke.  Their implementation became more complex since I was away, so for now I'm making due with Facebook (I resented a little bit having to sign in and get dragged down that rabbit-hole), but, it was important to get it working again for morale purposes.

I still kind of can't believe I made it this far.  Perhaps they'll make a developer out of me yet.

I have some thoughts on the DOM, involving analogies to genetics which will be another blog post soon <3
