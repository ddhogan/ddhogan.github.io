I recently remembered that my work-aversary was about a month ago.  
I was told that junior devs shouldn't start out working remotely.  It would be nearly impossible, and even if I found one, I would require too much mentorship and it would stunt my professional development.  Or something to that effect.
And while I was thrilled to be hired with this team as a remote contributor, I kept that sneaking fear all year.
In the absence of formal performance reviews or retrospectives, I conducted my own sort of informal review - introspection on what I've learned and accomplished, and where I'd like to improve, and goals. The scope 

## Wins
1. Learned how to write **browser automation tests**, including one involving a tricky race-condition that I wrote about in a pretentiously-titled [blog post](https://dev.to/ddhogan/puppeteer-stochasticity-and-timely-pauses-3kb6).
    * Ironically, I feel more comfortable writing these kinds of tests than writing unit tests. I would like to improve on this in the coming year.
1. Further developed my React/Router/Redux skills.
    * Even started ejecting React apps that were initialized with Create React App in order to customize webpack.
1. I got a little better at manipulating the contents of a **webpack config**, but I'm still nervous about it, and would like to be better at this in the future. And perhaps make my own React boilerplate rather than using CRA.
1. Became more fluent in Git/Github and integration with VSCode.
1. Dabbled in **Kibana** and PowerBI
1. Learned what **AWS Lambdas** are, and wrote my first!
    * Related to this, learned about **virtual environments for Python** projects.
1. My first **Docker-ized** web app!
1. **Asked for something**, and it was fine!
1. Wrote my first, very basic **chatbot** (using BotkitAI), that uses some simple NLP to make searches for you and reports back some answers.
    * Made a tiny contribution to its library.
1. Made use of **continuing education** resources like egghead.io, Udemy, YouTube, PluralSight, FreeCodeCamp, books, Slack/Discourse communities, Coursera, and lots of Podcasts. 
1. **Sass**'d around a little bit.  It's not so scary!
1. Started picking up a new JS framework: **Vue.js**!
1. Learned a lot about **a11y/accessibility**.  Running audits with aXe, Lighthouse, WAVE, and some basics about aria attributes, contrast and colors, and semantic HTML.  Tried a screen reader (gonna leave that to the pros)
1. Learned about **static site generators**, including Jekyll and eleventy, and spun up a simple one for a work assignment.

## Room for improvement
1. My **anxiety slows me down**. So, I've re-started therapy, and am re-visiting some old tools to help me cope (like mindfulness practices and rescue medications). It also prevents me from asking for help in a timely manner (like, asking a human is absolute last resort), but perhaps with practice this will improve.
2. **Writing tests** is still a challenge for me, particularly unit and functional tests.
3. **Webpack** is still mysterious and scary.  I can debug sorta (because the error messages are actually very good), and make certain edits, but would like to do better here.
4. I've **neglected my old portfolio projects**.  This means my resume is woefully out of date.  I need to either move them off, or update them.  I could also postpone this until I plan to start looking for another job.
5. **I haven't attended any meetups.** Just been too busy or out of energy.
    * But, I did buy tickets for [CodeLand 2020](https://codelandconf.com/), and am keeping an eye out for convenient and interesting local meetups.
6. While I keep good personal notes in markdown format, I haven't really been **keeping up with blogging** or any kind of communication about my learning progress (aside from daily stand-ups, but that's not really about my own development).
    * I want to **re-visit my personal blog/page**, and start writing in a more formal way and sharing it.  This post is part of that, like a tiny bit of accountability.
7. **Piles of learning fantasies:** In Todoist, the "backlog" and "lookit" things are overflowing, and I have a bookmark folder called "learn" and "current learning", and haven't touched them in some time, and then there's Pocket and the dozens of newsletters and Slack/Discord groups, ahhhh
    * Am I ever going to rescue the old Rails projects from Heroku? Before the stack's EOL???

On balance, I'm basically satisfied with my progress! It can be done! And while successfully managing chronic illness.  Becoming disabled may have prompted me to learn to code, but even if I miraculously was all better tomorrow, I'd still want to do the same work, I just might be more inclined to consider working on-site (for some portion of the week), or would attend meetups or tackle a more ambitious side-project.
Here's to another year! üë©‚Äçüíª
