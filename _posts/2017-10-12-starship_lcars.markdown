For my Sinatra portfolio project, I made an app for the various ficticious intelligence agencies in the Star Trek universe, based on the database they often use, called LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System).

In my little non-canonical version of this world, all the intelligence agencies share information =]
But of course, each agent has control over their own record (editing and deleting).
This app is devoted to keeping records of all warp-capable vessels, including sub-class, top speeds, and crew complement.

Some small things I'm proud of in this project:
* I experimented with flash messages!  Everywhere!
* Used conditional formatting in a view so that logged in users don't see the login and sign up buttons
* I made a custom 404 page (as a bonus it kept my own morale up as I worked on the app!  No more of that "Sinatra doesn't know this ditty..."
* Custom favicon
* consulted with my resident expert for the theme and terminology throughout
